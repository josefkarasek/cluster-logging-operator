# elasticsearch-operator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/elasticsearch-operator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/elasticsearch-operator)

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Elasticsearch operator to run Elasticsearch cluster on top of Openshift and Kubernetes.
Operator uses [Operator Framework SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).

## Why use operator?

Operator is designed to provide self-service for the Elasticsearch cluster operations. See the [diagram](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/images/Operator-Maturity-Model.png) on operator maturity model.

- Elasticsearch operator ensures proper layout of the pods
- Elasticsearch operator enables proper rolling cluster restarts
- Elasticsearch operator provides kubectl interface to manage your Elasticsearch cluster
- Elasticsearch operator provides kubectl interface to monitor your Elasticsearch cluster

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Cluster administrator must set `vm.max_map_count` sysctl to 262144 on the host level of each node in your cluster prior to running the operator.
- In case hostmounted volume is used, the directory on the host must have 777 permissions and the following selinux labels (TODO).
- In case secure cluster is used the certificates must be pre-generated and uploaded to the secret `<elasticsearch_cluster_name>-certs`

### Kubernetes

Make sure certificates are pre-generated and deployed as secret.
Upload the Custom Resource Definition to your Kubernetes cluster:

    $ kubectl create -f deploy/crd.yaml

Deploy the required roles to the cluster:

    $ kubectl create -f deploy/rbac.yaml

Deploy custom resource and the Deployment resource of the operator:

    $ kubectl create -f deploy/cr.yaml
    $ kubectl create -f deploy/operator.yaml

### OpenShift

As a cluster admin apply the template with the roles and permissions:

    $ oc process -f deploy/openshift/admin-elasticsearch-template.yaml | oc apply -f -

The template deploys CRD, roles and rolebindings. You can pass variables:

- `NAMESPACE` to specify which namespace's default ServiceAccount will be allowed to manage the Custom Resource.
- `ELASTICSEARCH_ADMIN_USER` to specify which user of OpenShift will be allowed to manage the Custom Resource.

For example:

    $ oc process NAMESPACE=myproject ELASTICSEARCH_ADMIN_USER=developer -f deploy/openshift/admin-elasticsearch-template.yaml | oc apply -f -

In case later-on grant permissions to extra users by giving them the role `elasticsearch-operator`.

As the user which was specified as `ELASTICSEARCH_ADMIN_USER` on previous step:

Make sure the secret with Elasticsearch certificates exists and is named `<elasticsearch_cluster_name>-certs`

Then process the following template:

    $ oc process -f deploy/openshift/elasticsearch-template.yaml | oc apply -f -

The template deploys the Custom Resource and the operator deployment. You can pass the following variables to the template:

- `NAMESPACE` - namespace where the Elasticsearch cluster will be deployed. Must be the same as the one specified by admin
- `ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTER_NAME` - name of the Elasticsearch cluster to be deployed

For example:

    $ oc process NAMESPACE=myproject ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTER_NAME=elastic1 -f deploy/openshift/elasticsearch-template.yaml | oc apply -f -

## Customize your cluster

### Image customization

The operator is designed to work with `openshift/origin-aggregated-logging` image.

### Storage configuration

Storage is configurable per individual node type. Possible configuration
options:

- Hostmounted directory
- Empty directory
- Existing PersistentVolume
- New PersistentVolume generated by StorageClass

### Elasticsearch cluster topology customization

Decide how many nodes you want to run.

### Elasticsearch node configuration customization

TODO

## Supported features

Kubernetes TBD+ and OpenShift TBD+ are supported.

- [x] SSL-secured deployment (using Searchguard)
- [x] Insecure deployment (requires different image)
- [x] Index per tenant

- [ ] Elasticsearch 6.x support
- [x] Elasticsearch 5.6.x support
- [x] Master role
- [x] Client role
- [x] Data role
- [x] Clientdata role
- [x] Clientdatamaster role
- [ ] Elasticsearch snapshots
- [ ] Prometheus monitoring
- [ ] Status monitoring

## Testing

### E2E Testing
To run the e2e tests, from the repo directory, run:
```
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
imagebuilder -t quay.io/openshift/elasticsearch-operator .
operator-sdk test local --namespace openshift-logging ./test/e2e/
```

### Dev Testing
To set up your local environment based on what will be provided by OLM, run:
```
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
ELASTICSEARCH_OPERATOR=$GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift/elasticsearch-operator

oc create -n openshift-logging -f $ELASTICSEARCH_OPERATOR/deploy/service_account.yaml
oc create -n openshift-logging -f $ELASTICSEARCH_OPERATOR/deploy/role.yaml
oc create -n openshift-logging -f $ELASTICSEARCH_OPERATOR/deploy/role_binding.yaml
oc create -n openshift-logging -f $ELASTICSEARCH_OPERATOR/deploy/crds/crd.yaml

oc create -n openshift-logging -f $ELASTICSEARCH_OPERATOR/deploy/cr.yaml
```

To test on an OCP cluster, you can run:
`OPERATOR_NAME=elasticsearch-operator WATCH_NAMESPACE=openshift-logging KUBERNETES_CONFIG=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig go run cmd/elasticsearch-operator/main.go`


To remove created API objects:
`oc delete Elasticsearch elasticsearch -n openshift-logging`
